# HR_Analysis

This repository contains a Jupyter notebook that analyzes a Human Resources dataset to understand factors influencing employee turnover.

The analysis includes:

Data loading and initial inspection
Handling duplicate entries
Descriptive statistics
Visualizations to explore relationships between various features (number of projects, average monthly hours, time spent in company, last evaluation, salary, promotion) and employee turnover.
The notebook identifies specific groups of employees who are more likely to leave based on their characteristics.
